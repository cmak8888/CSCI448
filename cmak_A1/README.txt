1) I used an enumerative property dependent on the question type. I also provided converted all my solutions to strings as well as a mostly empty solution bank for my multiple choice options.

2) I had to make modifications to the View Model to incorporate different variable types as well as for retrieving the multiple choice options. The QuizActivity Views and layouts needed to be modified to accommodate the different Quiz Question Types. The controller needed to be changed for the different necessary information as well.

3) I had to change a lot of the variable types and parameters for setting up the questions and retrieving the questions from the strings.xml file. I also had issues trying to access the strings.xml file.

4) The role of the ViewModel was to hold all of our questions and solutions in the question bank. Then it can be read, retrieved, and used to verify solutions with the main App: QuizActivity.

I added landscape functionality as well as making sure you cannot re-score the same question.
